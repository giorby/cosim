This package contains several components which are all open-source
but has been released under different licenses to help better integrate
them with the existing ecosystem. You can find the whole text of each
used license in the "licenses" directory, and each source file contains
an SPDX identifier that specifies the license that applies to it,
and acts as a placeholder for the full referenced license file.

As a general guideline, this is the rationale:
 - the C    code of the co-simulation modules is "GPL-2.0-or-later"
 - the VHDL code of the co-simulation modules is "Apache-2.0"
 - the compilation and convenience scripts are   "CC0-1.0"
the examples have their own individual licenses:
 - the firmware (mainly C    code) is "BSD-3-Clause"
 - the hardware (mainly VHDL code) is "CERN-OHL-W-2.0"
